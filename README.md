FeedbackReloaded
================

Feedback Reloaded allows users and visitors of a Drupal site to quickly send feedback messages about the currently displayed page. Visitors can highlight/blackout any area in webpage and can add notes about problem. Feedback Reloaded will take snapshot of current page and send it to site administrator. This helps site administrators in quality assurance of their website.

Website visitors and users are not expected to be expert in field of web development so the textual feedback provided by them might not be enough for the developer to track down the issue. Feedback Reloaded gives developers a screen shot of the webpage along with problem area highlighted and hence make it lot easy for developer to understand the exact problem and crack it.
